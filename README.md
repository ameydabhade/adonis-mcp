## üß† Sequential Thinking Analysis

The MCP server includes a sophisticated sequential thinking analyzer that processes market data through multiple reasoning steps:

### Analysis Steps:
1. **Current Price Analysis** - Evaluates current price movement and momentum
2. **Historical Trend Analysis** - Examines 5-day price patterns and volatility
3. **Volume Analysis** - Assesses trading volume relative to averages
4. **Final Recommendation** - Synthesizes all data into actionable insights

### Sample Output:
```
üß† Sequential Thinking Analysis for RELIANCE

## Thinking Process:
Step 1: Analyzing current price movement
Analysis: Current Price: ‚Çπ2,456.75, Previous Close: ‚Çπ2,445.20, Change: 0.47%
Conclusion: Current price momentum established
Next Action: Analyze historical trends

Step 2: Examining 5-day historical trend pattern
Analysis: 5-day trend: Upward, Recent volatility: ‚Çπ45.30
Conclusion: Stock shows upward momentum with moderate volatility
Next Action: Evaluate volume patterns

## Final Recommendation:
Action: HOLD
Reasoning: Neutral momentum, wait for clearer signals
Suggested Action: Monitor for breakout or breakdown signals
```

## üîí Security Notes

- **Never commit `config.env`** to version control
- **Regenerate access tokens daily** for security
- **Use paper trading** for testing before live trades
- **Monitor API rate limits** to avoid restrictions

## üìä Example Workflows

### 1. Daily Market Analysis
```python
# Fetch NIFTY data
fetch_data(symbol="NIFTY 50", days=5)

# Analyze with sequential thinking
analyze_data(symbol="NIFTY 50")

# Check current positions
monitor_orders()
```

### 2. Stock Trading Flow
```python
# Research stock
fetch_data(symbol="RELIANCE", days=10)
analyze_data(symbol="RELIANCE")

# Place order based on analysis
buy_stock(symbol="RELIANCE", quantity=5, order_type="MARKET")

# Monitor the order
monitor_orders(order_id="order_id_returned")
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Authentication Error**
   - Check if access token is valid (regenerate daily)
   - Verify API key and secret in config.env

2. **Symbol Not Found**
   - Use exact trading symbols (e.g., "RELIANCE" not "Reliance Industries")
   - Check if symbol is available on the specified exchange

3. **Order Placement Failed**
   - Ensure sufficient margin/balance
   - Check market hours (9:15 AM - 3:30 PM IST)
   - Verify order parameters

4. **Rate Limiting**
   - Kite Connect has API rate limits
   - Add delays between requests if needed

## üìà Advanced Features
